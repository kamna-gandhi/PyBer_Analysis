# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to improve accessibility to ride-sharing services for underserved communities. Using city and ride data which included parameters such as fare, driver count and city type, Pandas Dataframe were used to determine the average fares, the total number of rides, total number of drivers for each city type. Then the percentages of toatl fares, total rides and total drivers was determined for each city type. The Python graphing library Matplotlib was used to visualize this data and a final line graph displaying total fare by each city type was created.

## Results

#### Average Fare vs Total Number of Rides Per City
![AverageFare](https://github.com/kamna-gandhi/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/PyBerAverageFare.png)
* The graph above shows that the average fare for urban cities is lower and as shown by the dot size, urban cities also have more drivers.

#### Percentage of Total Drivers by City Type
![TotalDrivers](https://github.com/kamna-gandhi/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/PercentofTotalDrivers.png)
* This graph confirms that rural cities are underserved as they make up only 2.6% of total drivers.

#### Percentage of Total Rides by City Type

* This reiterates that rural cities are underserved as they make up only 5.3% of total rides. 

#### Total Fare by City Type
![Challenge](https://github.com/kamna-gandhi/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge_TotalFarebyCityType.png)
* This shows that among the three city types, urban cities generates the greatest total fare, while rural cities generate the lowest total fare. 

## Conclusion

Based on our analysis, here are 3 reccommendations for PyBer:
1) Provide incentives for drivers to work in rural and suburban cities.
2) To increase total revenue, consider increasing fares for urban cities as there is much more demand for ride-sharing services in those cities.
3) Before expanding services into the rural market, consider gathering data about the demand for ride-sharing services in these regions.
